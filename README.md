BIG-IQ Centralized Management Trial Quick Start
===============================================

F5 [BIG-IQ Centralized Management](https://www.f5.com/products/automation-and-orchestration/big-iq): Manage your BIG-IP devices â€” and the services they deliver.

This **CloudFormation Template (CFT)** or **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** creates two BIG-IQ VE instances: 

- a BIG-IQ Centralized Management (CM) instance to configure and orchestrate instances of BIG-IP VE
- a BIG-IQ Data Collection Device (DCD) to store analytics data. 

After you configure the BIG-IQ instances, BIG-IQ can manage any F5 BIG-IP physical and virtual devices. 
If your BIG-IPs are on premise in your Data Center, you will need a VPN or Direct link to either AWS or Azure.
